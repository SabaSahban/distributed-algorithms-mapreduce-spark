# Distributed Algorithms with MapReduce and Spark

This project focuses on implementing distributed algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and PageRank using Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark. It showcases large-scale data processing, including real-world datasets such as the E. coli genome and COVID-19 mortality data.

## Features
- **MapReduce**: Implements Dijkstra's and PageRank algorithms for distributed data processing.
- **PySpark**: Processes large datasets such as the E. coli genome.
- **Datasets**: Includes the E. coli genome and COVID-19 mortality data.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Managed with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Notebook**: Documented the Spark implementation in [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/SabaSahban/distributed-algorithms-mapreduce-spark/blob/main/spark/Docker/mnt/notebooks/spark-hw.ipynb).

## Tools Used
- **Hadoop**
- **PySpark**
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Datasets
- **E. coli Genome Dataset**
- **COVID-19 Mortality Data**
